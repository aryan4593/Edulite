It tells us about how people lived, what they ate, how they dressed, what they believed in, and how societies changed over time.\n\nHistory is not just about kings and wars. It is also about farmers, traders, teachers, scientists, and ordinary people who shaped the world.\n\n## Why is History Important?\n\nHistory helps us:\n- Understand our culture and traditions\n- Learn from past mistakes\n- Appreciate freedom and democracy\n- Know how inventions and discoveries changed our lives\n\nBy learning history, we understand our present better and make informed decisions for the future.\n\n## Sources of History\n\nWe learn about the past through different sources:\n\n1. **Written Sources** – Books, letters, manuscripts, newspapers\n2. **Archaeological Sources** – Coins, tools, pottery, buildings\n3. **Oral Sources** – Stories passed down from grandparents\n\nHistorians carefully study these sources to understand what happened in the past.\n\n## Timeline and Chronology\n\nA timeline helps us arrange events in the correct order. This is called chronology. It helps us understand which event happened first and which happened later.\n\nHistory is usually divided into three periods:\n- Ancient Period\n- Medieval Period\n- Modern Period\n\nEach period has its own importance and unique developments.",

It helps us understand the layout of an area such as a city, village, country, or even the whole world.\n\nMaps are smaller representations of large areas. They help us find locations, plan journeys, and understand distances.\n\n## Cardinal Directions\n\nThe four main directions are called cardinal directions:\n- North (N)\n- South (S)\n- East (E)\n- West (W)\n\nNorth is usually shown at the top of a map.\n\n## Intermediate Directions\n\nBetween the main directions, we also have:\n- North-East (NE)\n- North-West (NW)\n- South-East (SE)\n- South-West (SW)\n\nThese help us describe locations more accurately.\n\n## Compass\n\nA compass is an instrument used to find directions. The needle of a compass always points towards North.\n\n## Map Symbols and Scale\n\nMaps use symbols to represent real objects like schools, hospitals, roads, rivers, and parks.\n\nA scale shows the distance on a map compared to real distance. For example, 1 cm on a map may represent 1 km in real life.\n\n## Why Maps Are Important\n\nMaps help us:\n- Travel safely\n- Locate places\n- Understand geography\n- Plan routes\n\nExample: If the library is north of the school, it means the library is located above the school when looking at a map.",

      "text": "# Types and Scales of Maps\n\nMaps are useful tools that help us understand different features of the Earth. There are different types of maps, and each type shows specific information.\n\n## Types of Maps\n\n### 1. Political Maps\nPolitical maps show countries, states, cities, and their boundaries. They focus on borders and major human settlements.\n\n### 2. Physical Maps\nPhysical maps show natural features such as mountains, rivers, deserts, plateaus, and plains. They help us understand landforms.\n\n### 3. Thematic Maps\nThematic maps show specific information related to a particular topic. Examples include maps showing population, rainfall, climate, crops, or industries.\n\n### 4. Road Maps\nRoad maps show highways, streets, and transportation routes. They help travelers find directions.\n\n## Map Scale\n\nA map is smaller than the real world. Therefore, we use a scale to show the relationship between map distance and real distance.\n\nScale indicates the ratio between distances on the map and actual ground distances.\n\n### Types of Scale\n\n1. **Statement Scale** – Example: 1 cm = 1 km\n2. **Ratio Scale** – Example: 1 : 100000\n3. **Graphical (Bar) Scale** – A line drawn on the map showing distance\n\n## Importance of Scale\n\n- Helps measure real distances\n- Helps compare sizes of places\n- Makes maps accurate and useful\n\nWithout scale, we would not know the real size or distance between places.",

They help locate any place on Earth accurately.\n\nExample: New Delhi is approximately at 28.7° N latitude and 77.2° E longitude.\n\n## Importance of Coordinates\n\n- Help in navigation\n- Used in GPS systems\n- Help pilots and sailors travel safely\n- Used to determine time zones",
